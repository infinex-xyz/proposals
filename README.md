## How to contribute to Infinex Proposals

### Contributing

Before contributors begin writing their proposals, clearly identify what type of proposal you intend to make: [XIP](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/xips/xip-1), [IR](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/irs/ir-1-purpose-and-guidelines) or [WGC](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/wgcs/wgc-1). Contributors should follow their respective proposal templates, which are the first proposal of each category that specifically highlight their use-case and function. 

Contributors should then look to make a fork of this repository where they will write their proposal. Your first PR should be a final draft of the final proposal. It must then meet the correct formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header).

An editor will then manually review the first PR for a new proposal. After the PR has been merged into the site, a public Discord AMA presentation must be arranged with the Infinex Council and community. This presentation is necessary for gathering community feedback on relevant proposals.

Once the proposal is assessed and mature enough to move into a vote, reach out to the Proposals Editor who can be found in the Infinex Discord. A vote will now be set-up:

- For XIPs and WGCs, proposals are voted on by the Infinex Council. If a vote by the Infinex Council reaches a majority, the proposal is moved to Approved, otherwise it is Rejected.
- For IRs, proposals are voted on by Synthetix Debt Share holders (which will be replaced by Patron NFT holders once released), and must be passed by a minimum of 60% of the actual debt shares voted. Votes last for a total period of 7 days, after which it is either Approved or Rejected. Future IRs may take into consideration Governance Points holders.

Once the proposal has been implemented by either the Infinex DAO, proposal author, or any other relevant parties, the proposal is assigned the Implemented status.
