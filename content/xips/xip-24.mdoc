# Proposal Summary

XIP-24 proposes a minor revision to [XIP-21](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/xips/xip-21) by changing the airdrop to Solana users from Mad Lads holders to Saga owners.

# Specification

## Overview

Following recent discussions on XIP-21, a reconsideration of which crypto communities should recieve an airdrop is warranted. The changes proposed are:&nbsp;

1. Remove the [Mad Lads](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/mad_lads) airdrop allocation from XIP-21.&nbsp;
1. Grant the GP allocation to [Saga](https://solscan.io/collection/4a2d96b22ab0c8f01cb5ce5bc960b627c2a8271529ae5132d5352b7c86b3b54d) Owners.

## Rationale

Targeted airdrops attempt to make existing communities join other projectâ€™s community in return for a reward. Airdropping to Madlads holders is a suboptimal choice because of the collection size in comparison to Saga owners (9,967 vs 17,300). This allows us to reach a broader group of people.

Furthermore, sybils and whales getting outsized GP allocations from this proposed airdrop is less of a concern due to the physical restraint of owning the Saga device in order to acquire the NFTs.

## Technical Specification

A snapshot of Saga owners has been taken [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_Tq3ckSpLnOoCRvighnxjsRVD2YkIOj/view?usp=sharing).

19,895,000 GP will be distributed to these addresses. This is approximately 3.3% of the total GP supply and around 0.1% of the total supply. Wrapped GP will be distributed to a user's Solana address, and users can unwrap it by bridging it to Base.&nbsp;

This results in an allocation of 1,150 GP per NFT (17,300 Genesis NFTs were minted).
