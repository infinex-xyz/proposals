# Proposal Summary

XIP-73 proposes support for more NFT collections.

# Specification

## Overview

This proposal aims to add more supported NFT collections to Infinex. The Infinex Account can currently receive all NFTs, but only supported NFTs are displayed in the UI and allowed to be deposited and withdrawn.

The Infinex Platform will be updated to support the following collections:

- CryptoPunks
- Pudgy Penguins
- Pudgy Rods
- Azuki
- Bored Ape Yacht Club
- Mutant Ape Yacht Club
- Bored Ape Kennel Club
- Otherdeed for Otherside
- Meebits
- Milady Maker
- Doodles
- Redacted Remilio Babies
- Ethlizards

## Rationale

The CWG has progressed with the integration of [Initial Support for NFTs](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/xips/xip-69), and believes it is important to enable support for a wider range of more popular collections.

## Technical Specification

Infinex will add functionality for users to view these new NFT collections in-app. Functionality to deposit and withdraw these assets will also be added. The token addresses for these collections are:

In order to implement these upgrades, Infinex will simply need to upgrade the backend infrastructure to track these assets, and also reflect it in the UI.
