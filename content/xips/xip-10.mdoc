# Proposal Summary

This XIP specifies the initial value of the variables that will be used for the smart contract deployments on Ethereum Mainnet and Base for the Infinex Alpha.

# Specification

## Overview

The Infinex Protocol smart contracts will use the variables specified in the `InfinexProtocolConfigBeacon` for various purposes. The main categories they fall under are:

- Addresses to point to the right contract deployment
- Addresses for fee recipients
- Fees taken on trades and withdrawals

There is also a special note on fee caps.

Keep in mind these parameters can be changed with future governance proposals. Certain high-risk parameters will require the user to opt-in for updates as per [XIP-7](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/xips/xip-7).

## Rationale

As detailed in the previous XIPs ([6](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/xips/xip-6), [7](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/xips/xip-7) & [8](https://proposals.infinex.xyz/xips/xip-8)) there will be various parameters and settings required for the protocol to function. This includes the latest implementations of smart contract logic, locations and allow list of tokens, fees and more.

This XIP proposes the following values that will be required for the protocol to operate (e.g. contract addresses) and a good baseline for operational parameters (e.g. fees), which can be adjusted later if required.

## Technical Specification

The following tables outline the variables that will be used for the Ethereum Mainnet and Base deployments respectively.
