# Proposal Summary

XIP-58 proposes enabling support for Wormhole (W) token.

# Specification

## Overview

Infinex launched with an integration for Wormhole enabling seamless multi-chain support. It would be great to add support for the Wormhole (W) token on the following chains:

- Solana
- Ethereum
- Base
- Arbitrum One

## Rationale

The Wormhole token is supported by major exchanges and available on both EVM chains and Solana. For future usage it might be good to have staking support in the interface, but for the short term just support for additional tokens.

## Technical Specification

Infinex already has support for EVM & Solana tokens, so it just needs to update the backend to support the new token.

### Token contracts

- Solana [85VBFQZC9TZkfaptBWjvUw7YbZjy52A6mjtPGjstQAmQ]
- Ethereum [0xb0ffa8000886e57f86dd5264b9582b2ad87b2b91]
- Base [0xb0ffa8000886e57f86dd5264b9582b2ad87b2b91]
- Arbitrum One [0xb0ffa8000886e57f86dd5264b9582b2ad87b2b91]

### Token Format

Native ERC20 and SPL (using Wormholeâ€™s Native Token Transfer framework)
Token symbol: W
Max supply: 10,000,000,000
Initial circulating supply: 1,800,000,000
