# Proposal Summary

This XIP proposes support of the $SPX6900 token within the Infinex ecosystem.

# Specification

## Overview

$SPX6900 is a parody memecoin aiming to flip the entire stock market.

Currently, $SPX6900 is not displayed on Infinex.

## Rationale

Memecoins are one of the hottest narratives in crypto right now, and a variety of Infinex community members have requested support for them. Memecoins also have no utility, which means most users are simply holding them in a wallet. This means users will be more likely to deposit these assets into their Infinex Account due to lower opportunity costs.

## Technical Specification

A list of the supported token, network, and token address can be found below. Infinex will add support for deposit and withdrawals for all of the listed tokens.
