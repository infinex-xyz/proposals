# **Outcome**

Update the fees taken on swaps.

# **Overview**

This RC proposes a new fee structure to be implemented for Swaps.

- "Swap" here means from and to are on the same chain.
- "Stable" here means the same underlying asset is the price driver (ie a nominal 1:1 and non volatile swap ratio), eg USDC and USDT are both `usd`, ETH, WETH and STETH are all `eth` etc.
- "Swidge" refers to the swapping and bridging of an asset, i.e ETH â†’ SOL.
- Fees are all in bps
