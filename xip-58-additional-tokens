# Proposal Summary

XIP-58 proposes enabling support for Wormhole (W) token.

# Specification
## Overview

Infinex launched with a technology integration for Wormhole enabling seamless multi-chain support. It would be great to add support for the Wormhole (w) token on the following chains:
- Solana 
- Ethereum 
- Base 
- Arbitrum One

## Rationale
Wormhole token is supported by mayor exchanges and availble on EVM and Solana chains and wallets. For future usage it might be good to have staking support in the interface, but for the short term just support for additional tokens.

## Technical Specification
Infinex already has support for EVM & Solana tokens, so it just needs to update the back-end to support the new token and update logo's and assets.

### Token contracts
- Solana [85VBFQZC9TZkfaptBWjvUw7YbZjy52A6mjtPGjstQAmQ]

- Arbitrum One [0xb0ffa8000886e57f86dd5264b9582b2ad87b2b91]
